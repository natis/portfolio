		Why hello there. Glad you took the time to view source.
		So a bit about this site. It's just simple HTML, CSS, and some JS. Nothing more because there is beauty in simplicity.
		Built using VS Code as my editor because that's where the action currently is but I have spent time using:
		BBEdit (when it was around version 2)
		Notepad ++
		Macromedia Dreamweaver (don't judge, it was a requirement at the time, and yes, back before Adobe acquired Macromedia)
		Textmate
		Brackets
		Atom
		Sublime Text
		Eclipse
		Xcode
		
		I've been around the block.
		Why not use the latest hotness (which at the time of this is React with Next.js but Vue.js seems to be catching up)?
		Because this is just a one page site. Sass was used in the build process because it really is faster but that's more preference
		than need.
		Anyway, if you're looking at the source as a means to learn something, get really good at HTML, CSS, plain ol' vanilla Javascript and
		accessibility. If you focus on learning a framework or a build process, you may find yourself having a harder time to pivot as trends change.
